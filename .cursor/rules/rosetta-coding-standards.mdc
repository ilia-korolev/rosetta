# Rosetta Project - Coding Standards

## Core Practices
- Use `const` constructors, composition over inheritance
- Use **dart_mappable** for data classes (auto-generates copyWith, ==, hashCode)
- Create small, focused widgets; prefer `StatelessWidget`
- Follow **very_good_analysis** lint rules
- Keep functions small (max 20-30 lines)

## Code Formatting & Quality
- **ALWAYS run `dart format .` after making code changes**
- **ALWAYS run `dart fix --apply` to automatically apply available fixes**
- Ensure consistent formatting across the entire codebase
- Use the default Dart formatter settings (80-character line limit)
- Apply automated fixes for lint violations and deprecated APIs
- Format and fix before committing any changes to maintain code consistency
- Consider setting up auto-format on save in your IDE for efficiency

### Recommended Workflow
1. Make your code changes
2. Run `dart fix --apply` to apply automatic fixes
3. Run `dart format .` to format the code
4. Review and commit your changes

## Desktop-First Design
- Design for larger screens with keyboard shortcuts
- Support mouse interactions (hover, right-click)
- Optimize for file operations and large datasets
- Consider multi-window support

## Performance
- Use `ListView.builder()` for large lists
- Implement proper resource disposal (controllers, streams, blocs)
- Use `const` constructors extensively
- Cache parsed ARB data

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit/widget/bloc tests using **bloc_test** and **mocktail**
- Mock get_it dependencies in tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Documentation Guidelines
- Document public APIs, business logic, ARB format specifics
- Use `///` for public members, focus on "why" not "what"
- Keep documentation current with code changes

## Quality Assurance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful file operation errors, meaningful messages, retry mechanisms, user-friendly recovery
- **Security**: Validate file inputs, handle untrusted ARB files safely, sanitize user inputs
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, efficient data structures, pagination, caching, background processing
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast themes, font scaling

When suggesting code changes or new features, always consider:
1. How it fits into the clean architecture
2. Bloc pattern implementation with get_it dependency injection
3. Performance implications for large translation files
4. Desktop-first design principles
5. Cross-platform compatibility
6. File operation safety and error handling
7. Testing requirements with mocktail mocking
8. Security implications for file operations
9. Accessibility for translation professionals
10. Code maintainability and extensibility

Remember: Write code that is readable, testable, and maintainable. Prioritize user experience for translation professionals.
